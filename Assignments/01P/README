How many hours did you take to complete this assignment?
6 hours.

How difficult did you find this assignment from a scale of 0-10 where 10 represents the hardest?
7

What challenges did you encounter? And how did you address them?
When I attempted to store the data into vector, only valid doubles are allowed
to be stored into vector. It took me a lot of minutes to figure out how to recognize
valid doubles. In the end, I used the self-defined is_double function to figure it out.
