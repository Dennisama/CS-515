mysterySort1 is  Bubble Sort.
Your evidence: Largest items "bubble up" to the top on each iteration. Another
interesting property is that, if the array is already in descending, after largest
items bubble up, the order of the rest items remain unchanged.

mysterySort2 is Heap Sort.
Your evidence: Largest items also "bubble up" to the top on each iteration. The
difference with Bubble Sort is that, when the array is in the descending order, the
order of other items change dramatically after the largest bubbles up. But if you draw
a heap, you could see they descend "level by level", because they are built by a heap.

mysterySort3 is Insertion Sort.
Your evidence: The first few items in the array will be firstly ordered in ascending,
but the minimum item is still hidden in the rest of array. Because insertion sort does
comparison on each item and moves slowly.

mysterySort4 is Quick Sort.
Your evidence: After some tryouts, I found the pivot is the left-most number. After
first iteration, it is moved to its correct position in the whole array. The left side
are all elements smaller than the pivot, the right side are all elements greater than the
pivot. Then it recurse the algorithm. This design is different with other sorting methods.

mysterySort5 is Selection Sort.
Your evidence: The smallest item in the (rest of) array is moved to the beginning in
each iteration.

The erase part of Trie is a little confusing. If it expects to delete nodes each time, we need
to track the parent information, as someone mentioned in the Piazza, we needed to delete from
the leaf node to the top. But the professor said it just expected lazy deletion, which was easier to
be implemented.
